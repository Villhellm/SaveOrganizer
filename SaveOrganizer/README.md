There are two ways to change the source location for a game.
Select the game you want in the "Game" Dropdown, then
1. Right click the dropdown box and select "Change Savefile Source"
2. Use the top menu (File> Edit Current Game>Set Savefile Source)

ALWAYS ON TOP

If you would like this window to always be on top of other open windows, open the settings menu (File>Settings) and tick the "Always On Top" box.

HOTKEYS

If you want to use the hotkeys in-game, make sure you are running the game as Administrator
(To do this, right click the SaveOrganizer.exe and select "Run as administrator. If you don't want to do this every time you launch, you can set it to run as Admin on default. Right click the exe, select properties, go to the "Compatibility" tab, and tick the box that says "Run this program as an administrator" near the bottom.)

    ENABLE HOTKEYS
    
    In the settings menu (File>Settings) tick the box that says "Toggle Global Hotkeys."
    
  SAVE NEW HOTKEY
  
  Make sure global hotkeys are enabled, and enable the option you want by selecting the checkbox to the left of it. Save a hotkey by clicking on the box to the right of the option you want to set a hotkey for (this will say "None" for options that have never been set). You can record almost any keyboard key, and up to one modifier key (Shift, Alt, Ctrl) if you so choose.
  Make sure to click the save button to save your changes.
  
  USING HOTKEYS
  
  When hotkeys are enabled, press the saved key to do the action it was saved to. Here is a list of the hotekys and what they do:
    
    "Export Selected Save" this will export whatever save you select in the savefile list (select files by clicking on them. As long as      any cell in that row is blue, the savefile is selected) to the source file. 
    
    "Import Current Save" this will import the source savefile and add it to your savefile list. You can rename it later.
    
    "Toggle Read Only" this will enable and disable read only on the source savefile.
    
    "Quick-Save" this currently only works in Dark Souls 1. Using this hotkey in game will immediately quit to main menu, save you game     to a special "Quicksave" location (there is one quicksave per game) and open the menu to the save select screen.
    
    "Quick-Load" exact same functionality as "Quick-Save" except it loads your Quicksave file.
    
    "Warp to Last Spawn" this currently only works in Dark Souls 1. This will teleport your character back to your load point. If you   haven't died, it will be wherever your savefile spawn is. If you have died, it will take you back to your last bonfire. This can be a useful practice tool, and good for timing running segments.
